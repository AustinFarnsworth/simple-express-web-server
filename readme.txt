What else can you do with Node Packages?
You can install other packages that can do basically anything you want. 
Like add pictures of cats or change the color the the terminal

What else can you do with Express?
It allows you to run multiple http requests for a specific URL

What other technologies could you use instead of Express?
Koa is one which is like express but it doesn't bundle any middleware
 within its core. 
 Sail.js is also one that is supposed to build off Express with higher
 level funcionalities like a bidirectional event-based communication
 between the client and server allowing you to connect to the API faster
 with out it going to idling mode. 

How is hosting in Express different than how you've hosted before?
It allows you to use middleware to both request and receive respones 
fairly easily.
